# Current Task: Comprehensive Testing and Refinement

## Current Objective
Implement comprehensive testing and refinement for the RPG Archivist Web application, including unit tests, end-to-end tests, performance testing, accessibility testing, cross-browser compatibility tests, security testing, and load testing.

## Context
This task is part of Phase 9 (Testing and Refinement) from the project roadmap. It ensures that the application is thoroughly tested, performs well, is accessible to all users, works across different browsers, is secure, and can handle the expected load. This phase is critical before moving to the launch phase.

## Previous Task Completion

- Authentication system with JWT tokens
- User management with role-based access control
- RPG World CRUD operations
- Campaign management with user relationships
- Session tracking and management
- Character creation and relationship management
- Location hierarchy management
- Entity relationship system for connecting different entities
- Comprehensive test suite for API endpoints
- Session Analysis Service with transcription processing
- Analysis algorithms for extracting insights from transcriptions
- API endpoints for session analysis operations
- Integration between transcription and analysis services
- Error handling and validation for session analysis
- Fixed all TypeScript errors in the backend codebase, improving type safety and maintainability
- Successfully started the application with backend on port 4000 and frontend on port 3000

## Current Status
- All TypeScript errors in the backend codebase have been fixed
- The application is running correctly with backend server on port 4000 and frontend on port 3000
- Fixed runtime errors in the frontend by:
  - Standardizing API URL configuration
  - Consolidating API client implementations
  - Improving error handling in AuthContext
  - Enhancing debug script for better error logging
- Fixed Puppeteer functionality for UI testing and screenshots:
  - Created basic test scripts to diagnose and fix connection issues
  - Developed comprehensive navigation scripts for capturing screenshots
  - Built a full-featured utility script for testing login/logout and UI verification
  - Generated screenshots of all main pages for documentation
- There are still some TypeScript warnings in the frontend code and errors in the test files
- Next steps include fixing the test files and addressing frontend TypeScript warnings
