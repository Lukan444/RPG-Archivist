# Current Task: AI-Assisted Storytelling Tools Implementation

## Current Objective
Implement AI-assisted storytelling tools for RPG sessions, including chat functionality with AI Brain for current sessions and tools for extracting information from past sessions to update the database through the proposal system.

## Context
This task is part of Phase 4 (AI Integration) from the project roadmap. It builds upon the previously implemented AI-powered session analysis functionality to provide storytelling assistance for game masters and players. This helps enhance the RPG experience by providing real-time suggestions, lore extraction, and database updates based on session content.

## Previous Task Completion
The previous task (AI-Powered Session Analysis) has been fully completed. The system now supports:

- Automatic analysis of session transcriptions
- Summary generation for quick session overview
- Key points extraction with categorization and importance scoring
- Character insights with participation metrics and notable quotes
- Character interaction analysis with sentiment scoring
- Plot development extraction with related entities
- Sentiment analysis with distribution and timeline visualization
- Topic extraction with keywords and relevance scoring
- Interactive analysis UI with synchronized audio playback

## Current Steps
1. ⬜ Design storytelling interface architecture
2. ⬜ Implement chat functionality with AI Brain for current sessions
3. ⬜ Create tools for extracting information from past sessions
4. ⬜ Implement proposal system for database updates
5. ⬜ Add custom prompt templates for each entity type
6. ⬜ Implement context-aware suggestions based on campaign/session
7. ⬜ Create UI for storytelling tools
8. ⬜ Add integration with existing session analysis functionality

## Technical Implementation Details
- **Backend**: TypeScript with Express.js and Neo4j database
- **Frontend**: React with Material UI
- **LLM Integration**: OpenAI API for AI Brain functionality
- **Data Models**: Storytelling interface, proposal system, prompt templates
- **Graph Database**: Neo4j for storing and retrieving context information
- **UI Components**: Chat interface, proposal review, context selection

## Implementation Plan

### 1. Storytelling Interface Architecture
- Design modular architecture for storytelling tools
- Create data models for chat messages, proposals, and context
- Implement service layer for LLM integration

### 2. Chat Functionality with AI Brain
- Implement chat interface for real-time interaction
- Create context management for providing relevant information to LLM
- Add support for different conversation modes (GM assistance, character roleplay, etc.)

### 3. Information Extraction from Past Sessions
- Create tools for analyzing past session transcriptions
- Implement entity extraction for characters, locations, items, etc.
- Add relationship identification between extracted entities

### 4. Proposal System for Database Updates
- Design proposal data model with status tracking
- Implement proposal generation from extracted information
- Create review interface for approving/rejecting proposals
- Add transaction-based application of approved proposals

### 5. Custom Prompt Templates
- Create template system for different entity types
- Implement template management UI
- Add variable substitution for dynamic content

### 6. Context-Aware Suggestions
- Implement context selection for campaign/session
- Create suggestion generation based on selected context
- Add relevance scoring for suggestions

### 7. Storytelling Tools UI
- Design and implement chat interface
- Create proposal review UI
- Add context selection components
- Implement suggestion display

### 8. Integration with Session Analysis
- Create connections between storytelling tools and session analysis
- Implement data sharing between components
- Add navigation between related features

## Dependencies
- Neo4j graph database for storing and retrieving context
- OpenAI API for LLM integration
- React and Material UI for frontend components
- Existing session analysis functionality

## Notes
- The quality of suggestions depends on the quality of the context provided
- Consider implementing caching for LLM responses to improve performance
- Privacy considerations should be addressed for user-generated content
- Rate limiting and error handling are important for API integration
- Consider adding support for local LLM models in the future
