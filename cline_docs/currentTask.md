# Current Task

## Current Objective

Develop a web-based version of the RPG Archivist application to address persistent issues and provide a more modern user experience

## Context

This task is a major new initiative to address several persistent issues in the desktop application, particularly with the Brain feature and database integration. The web UI will provide a more modern, accessible, and feature-rich experience while maintaining compatibility with the existing desktop application.

## Completed Steps

1. Analyzed current issues with the desktop application:
   - Identified persistent problems with Brain feature database integration
   - Documented issues with session name updates not being properly saved
   - Noted problems with Ollama settings not being persisted
   - Recognized limitations of the current PyQt-based UI

2. Developed a comprehensive plan for the web-based version:
   - Created detailed architecture overview for frontend and backend
   - Defined feature implementation roadmap with phases
   - Outlined technical advantages of the web UI approach
   - Developed implementation strategy with parallel development

3. Documented the web UI plan:
   - Created webUIImplementation.md in cline_docs folder
   - Updated memory-bank/activeContext.md with web UI information
   - Added web UI plan to development priorities

4. Attempted to fix persistent issues in the desktop application:
   - Improved the _collect_change_operations method for session updates
   - Enhanced the _apply_session_change method for database updates
   - Added better UI refresh mechanism after applying changes
   - Added more detailed logging for debugging

5. Implemented backend API endpoints (Phase 2 completed):
   - Created core entity models (RPG World, Campaign, Session, Character, Location)
   - Implemented authentication and user management
   - Added relationship management between entities
   - Implemented Power/Skill endpoints with character relationships
   - Added Item endpoints with character and location relationships
   - Created Event and Timeline endpoints with comprehensive relationships

## Next Steps

1. Implement Core Frontend (Phase 3):
   - Install and configure UI framework (Material UI or Tailwind CSS)
   - Set up responsive layout system
   - Create theme configuration with dark/light mode support
   - Design and implement navigation components
   - Create reusable UI components library
   - Set up form validation system

2. Implement Authentication UI:
   - Create login page and registration form
   - Add password reset UI
   - Implement authentication state management
   - Create protected route system
   - Add user profile and settings pages

3. Implement core UI components (2-3 weeks):
   - Create main layout and navigation
   - Build RPG World, Campaign, and Session views
   - Implement responsive design
   - Add basic CRUD operations

4. Add audio recording and transcription (2-3 weeks):
   - Implement browser-based audio recording
   - Create audio visualization components
   - Integrate OpenAI Whisper API
   - Build transcription display and editing UI

5. Continue maintaining the desktop application:
   - Fix critical bugs as they arise
   - Ensure database compatibility between desktop and web versions
   - Provide support for existing users

A detailed implementation plan has been created in cline_docs/webUIImplementationChecklist.md
