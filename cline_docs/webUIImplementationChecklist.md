# Web UI Implementation Checklist

## Purpose of this Checklist

This document serves as a comprehensive task tracking system for implementing the web-based version of RPG Archivist. It provides a structured approach to development, ensuring that all necessary steps are completed in a logical order.

## Checklist Usage Rules

1. **Sequential Completion**: Tasks should be completed in the order presented. Before moving to a new task, verify that the previous task is fully completed.

2. **Verification Process**: Before marking any task as complete, explicitly verify that all requirements of the task have been met. Only mark a checkbox as done when the answer to "Is this task fully completed?" is definitively "yes".

3. **Documentation**: When completing a task, document any important decisions, challenges, or lessons learned.

4. **Dependency Management**: Some tasks may have dependencies on tasks in other sections. These dependencies should be noted and respected.

5. **Flexibility**: While the checklist provides a structured approach, it can be adapted as needed based on project requirements and discoveries during implementation.

6. **Progress Tracking**: Use this checklist in all communications about the web UI implementation to maintain a clear understanding of project status.

7. **Revision**: The checklist can be revised and expanded as needed, but any changes should be documented.

## Task Completion Verification Questions

Before marking any task as complete, answer these questions:

1. Does the implementation meet all requirements specified in the task?
2. Has the implementation been tested thoroughly?
3. Is the code well-documented and following best practices?
4. Are there any known issues or limitations with the implementation?
5. Has the implementation been reviewed by another team member (if applicable)?
6. Is the implementation integrated with the rest of the system?
7. Are there any follow-up tasks that should be added to the checklist?

Only when all relevant questions can be answered positively should the task be marked as complete.
