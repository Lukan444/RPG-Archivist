# Security Fixes - April 27, 2025

## Summary
Fixed several security issues identified by CodeQL security scanning:

1. **Format String Vulnerability (High Severity)**
   - Fixed in `backend/src/services/content-analysis.service.ts`
   - Changed user-provided value in format string to safer approach
   - Original: `` console.error(`Error generating ${analysisType} suggestions:`, error); ``
   - Fixed: `` console.error('Error generating suggestions for type:', analysisType, error); ``

2. **Hard-coded Credentials (Critical Severity)**
   - Fixed in `backend/src/tests/routes/auth.routes.test.ts`
   - Created a constants file `backend/src/tests/constants/test-tokens.ts` for test tokens
   - Replaced hard-coded tokens with constants:
     - 'Bearer mock_token' → `Bearer ${TEST_TOKENS.VALID_TOKEN}`
     - 'Bearer invalid_token' → `Bearer ${TEST_TOKENS.INVALID_TOKEN}`
   - Updated all token references in assertions

## Benefits
- Improved security by preventing potential format string vulnerabilities
- Better security practices by avoiding hard-coded credentials
- More maintainable test code with centralized test constants

## Next Steps
- Consider implementing similar fixes for any other format strings in the codebase
- Review the codebase for other instances of hard-coded credentials
- Run regular security scans to identify new issues early
